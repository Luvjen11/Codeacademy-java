# FizzBuzz Java Project
## Overview
The FizzBuzz project is a simple programming exercise used to teach basic coding concepts and logic. It is often one of the first problems assigned to beginners. The goal of this project is to create a Java application that prints numbers from 1 to a specified limit, with specific conditions:

* For multiples of 3, print "Fizz" instead of the number.
* For multiples of 5, print "Buzz" instead of the number.
* For multiples of both 3 and 5, print "FizzBuzz" instead of the number.
